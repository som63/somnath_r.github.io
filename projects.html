<p>
This project focuses on understanding collective dynamical behaviors in 
<strong>classical and quantum oscillator networks</strong>. 
The primary aim is to analyze synchronization transitions, amplitude death,
and collective resonance phenomena arising from nonlinear coupling, delay,
and external driving.
</p>

<p>
Special emphasis is placed on <strong>quantum oscillator ensembles</strong>,
where control of quantum fluctuations and decoherence is crucial for 
applications in <strong>quantum technologies and quantum information processing</strong>.

<h2>2. Flow-Induced Vibration in Nonlinear Systems</h2>
<p>
This project investigates <strong>flow-induced vibrations (FIV)</strong> in 
nonlinear fluid–structure interaction systems, which are commonly encountered
in aerospace, mechanical, and civil engineering applications.
</p>

<p>
The research aims to understand the onset of nonlinear instabilities, resonance,
and chaotic oscillations due to fluid forcing, and to develop <strong>control strategies</strong>
to suppress undesirable vibrations.
</p>

<p>
Advanced nonlinear analysis techniques are employed to study bifurcation
structures and stability boundaries of the coupled fluid–structure systems.
</p>

<p><strong>Collaborator:</strong><br>
Prof. Sunetra Sarkar (Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Madras)

<h2>3. Nonlinear Energy Sinks and Targeted Energy Transfer</h2>
<p>
This project explores <strong>targeted energy transfer (TET)</strong> mechanisms
using <strong>nonlinear energy sinks (NES)</strong> for vibration mitigation in
mechanical systems.
</p>

<p>
The focus is on understanding energy localization, irreversible energy transfer,
and dissipation in strongly nonlinear oscillatory systems under transient and
periodic excitations.
</p>

<p>
Applications include vibration control in engineering structures and 
energy management in nonlinear lattices and oscillator chains.

<h2>4. Quantum Nonlinear Oscillators and Fluctuation Control: Applications in Quantum Computing</h2>
<p>
This project investigates <strong>fast-driven quantum nonlinear oscillators</strong>
with the goal of controlling quantum fluctuations, noise-induced heating, and
decoherence effects.
</p>

<p>
The study combines nonlinear dynamics, quantum control theory, and statistical
physics to understand how external modulation can be used to engineer effective
quantum states.
</p>

<p>
Potential applications include <strong>quantum computing architectures</strong>,
quantum sensing, and quantum-enhanced information processing.
